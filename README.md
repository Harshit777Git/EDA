# EDA
EDA LAB ASSIGNMENT 
This project simulates an IoT data pipeline. A simulated sensor (device_simulator.py) generates data and sends it to a queue. An Edge Function (local_function.py) processes the data locally, checking for high-temp/low-moisture alerts. Finally, a Dashboard (dashboard.py) visualizes the processed data in real-time. This mirrors the Azure IoT Edge architecture.
